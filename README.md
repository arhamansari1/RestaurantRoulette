# RestaurantRoulette

Note: not all images have been used so feel free to use any of the ones located in the "images" folder


A website application to facilitate the needs of hungry students at Adelphi University!
Via a randomization generator, groups of students may enter their restaurant choices and insert them inside a roulette. The selection will generate a random restaurant that will allow students to decide where to eat without any indecisive feelings.
